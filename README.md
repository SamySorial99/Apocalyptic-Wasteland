Hi, I was trying to make a good 3rd person controller where i can control every aspect like:
- The step height.
- Two speeds for running and walking.
- Ik movement for the head and the weapon.
- Blending animations.
- Simple pick up system.

to do:
- crouch 




ps: you need to un compress the NewCharTest with winrar as it was to big to push on github.
